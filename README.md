# urinary-uric-acid-estimator
This is a personal project to develop a device to measure the amount of uric acid (urate) within human urine.

Hyperuricemia (high amounts of uric acid in blood) can cause pathologies such as gout, where the urate crystalise and accumulate in joints, causing severe pain at the joints. A large portion of uric acid is excreted through urine; measuring the uric acid concentration in the blood and urine is important to monitor diseases such as gout. 

Conventionally, the measurement of uric acid is done through enzymatic biochemical analysis. However, it has been proven that UV absorbance analysis can estimate the uric acid levels within urine accurately. (Lin, et. al, 2022) This project aims to create a device to monitor the uric acid levels in urine with only UV absorbance analysis, to make the monitoring process easier and more accessible.

I designed and assembled this device based by myself, backed by research from [Lin, et. al]. The code for operating the sensor is taken from the Sparkfun AS7331 Arduino Library under MIT license.
